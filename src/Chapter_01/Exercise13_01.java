/*
 * *1.13 (Algebra: solve 2 * 2 linear equations) You can use Cramerâ€™s rule to 
    solve the following 2 * 2 system of linear equation:
    ax + by = e
    cx + dy = f
    x = (ed - bf) / (ad - bc)
    y = (af - ec) / (ad - bc)
Write a program that solves the following equation and displays the value for x and y:
3.4x + 50.2y = 44.5
2.1x + .55y = 5.9

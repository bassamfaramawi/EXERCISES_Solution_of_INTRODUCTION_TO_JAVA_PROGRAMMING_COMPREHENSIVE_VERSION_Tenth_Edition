 **5.7 (Financial application: compute future tuition) Suppose that the tuition 
for a university is $10,000 this year and increases 5% every year. In one year, 
the tuition will be $10,500. Write a program that computes the tuition in ten 
years and the total cost of four yearsâ€™ worth of tuition after the tenth year.

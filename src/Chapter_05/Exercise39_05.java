/*
 *5.39 (Financial application: find the sales amount) You have just started a 
sales job in a department store. Your pay consists of a base salary and a 
commission. The base salary is $5,000. The scheme shown below is used to 
determine the commission rate.

       Sales Amount                Commission Rate
       $0.01–$5,000                8 percent
       $5,000.01–$10,000           10 percent
       $10,000.01 and above        12 percent

Note that this is a graduated rate. The rate for the first $5,000 is at 8%, the 
next $5000 is at 10%, and the rest is at 12%. If the sales amount is 25,000, the 
commission is 5,000 * 8% + 5,000 * 10% + 15,000 * 12% = 2,700.
Your goal is to earn $30,000 a year. Write a program that finds the minimum 
sales you have to generate in order to make $30,000.
